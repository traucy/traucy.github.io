        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          For a senior interaction design course at Simon Fraser University, our team was tasked with seeking a local organization in Vancouver whose values we shared. Arc’teryx’s philosophy as a design company and commitment to sustainability resonated with our team, and we were lucky to be able to collaborate with the Kitsilano and Metrotown branches.
        </p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          Conducted on-site ethnography, user research and interviews, and led the visual design of presentation slides. Facilitated remote co-design workshop and design sprints. Designed, ideated and illustrated product care artifacts. Designed online experience of receiving product care gifts.

        <p class="max-body-width">
          Arc'teryx customers are able to choose a free gift upon purchasing an item (online or in-store). We decided on gifts because we wanted to make product care knowledge available to every customer free of cost.

          The magnet is a product care guide made from Gore-tex scraps, which was an environmentally conscious decision. The back of the grommet is magnetic, so people can stick it on their laundry machines.

        <h2>Initial Questions</h2>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          To begin, we set the course for our research by asking ourselves:
        </p>
        <div class="smallspacer"></div>

        <h3 class="max-body-width">How does Arc’teryx’s design and philosophy fit in the context of urban lifestyle?</h3>
        <div class="smallspacer"></div>

        <h3 class="max-body-width">Who are the people embedded in the Arc’teryx community whose behaviors and rituals best represent Arc’teryx enthusiasts?</h3>
        <div class="smallspacer"></div>

        <h3 class="max-body-width">What rituals do people who purchase Arc’teryx practice at home, when browsing in store, or when outdoors with their gear?</h3>
        <div class="smallspacer"></div>

        <h2>Ethnography & Interviews</h2>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          We began our research by visiting and observing each store across the lower mainland to understand their unique programs, while keeping in frequent contact with the store manager and marketing leads. During hour long sessions of undercover browsing, we took field notes, photos, and conducted interviews with product guides regarding customer-employee interactions.
        </p>

        <p class="max-body-width">
          To attain a nuanced and learned understanding of Arc’teryx customers, we conducted 8 qualitative interviews seeking to understand motivations, behaviors, and rituals. We sought out the people who were best able to shed light on our questions which included athletes, outdoor enthusiasts, urban commuters, techwear fans, and casual shoppers.

          I helped facilitate a 1h 30min online workshop (quarantine style) using Miro to better understand the wants, needs, desires and feasibility of ideas for an intervention. In this workshop we better understood the lens of product care through Arc'teryx employees. Together we did activities like Visual Toolkit, Mashup, Spider, Crazy 8's and made a journey map.

          Over the course of a few weeks, we came up with over online and in-store 100 ideas, with each intervention tackling product care in its own way. I facilitated some design sprinting, design thinking, and sketching activities as well as had spontaneous ideation sessions on our figma board.

          A wise man once said:
        </p>
        <h3 class="max-body-width">
          "You start designing when you start making decisions. What you decide to leave out is just as important as what you leave in."
        </h3>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          That man was my professor, who was guiding our team when we had too many ideas for online and in-store interventions.

          Throughout this 14 week project we received critique and feedback from our work which was invaluable to our team. The feedback we received from the people we interviewed, the people at Arc'teryx, and our peers drove the direction of our project. The product care magnet and bandana are simple objects that do their one thing well.

          Our process throughout this project was never linear, it was constant diverging and converging from critiques and meetings with Arc'teryx, our class, and ourselves. I'm really proud of myself and my team for giving it our all, and thankful for Arc'teryx for giving us design students this oppurtunity.
        </p>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          Something we struggled with was framing our design focus because we started without a brief or direction. We also spent a long time deciding what artifact we were going to design (out of the hundreds we brainstormed), I learned that just like experiences, everything is interconnected and our team can create a family of artifacts to give people choices and alternatives.
          I learned that as designers, we have the power to shape the experience, and we can direct people's behaviour, but do it in a way where they can actually respond. I also got more experience facilitating workshops and exercices. There's countless more that I learned, which I won't include here, but feel free to email me if you'd like to know more.
        </p>
        <p class="max-body-width">
          The last thing I learned was to trust the process as we faced obstacles. Give love to your craft but also to the research and data.
          Like Hillary Coe said: "Do the work. Hold the vision. Trust the process. Learn from your mistakes."
